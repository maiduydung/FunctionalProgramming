Deterministic Finite Automata
    Virtual machine state starting from initial one, continuing at every input
    Defined as 5 element tuple

Regular Expressions and Finite Automata
    non-determinism: 
        multiple transition destination
        if there is only 1 transition accepted, accept input
    
    epsilon-transition:
        transition without having any input
